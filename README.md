# My V0 Project

## Project Overview
My V0 Project is a web application built using the Next.js framework, integrated with React and TypeScript. It leverages a modern UI component library, Radix UI, and utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. The project is set up to develop a responsive and user-friendly interface with customizable themes and animations.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-v0-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using npm or yarn**
   You can use either npm or yarn to install the dependencies. Here are the commands for both:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your project in action.

## Usage

After starting the server, you can modify the components and pages located in the `/components` and `/pages` directories to start building your application. The application supports hot reloading, so you can see changes in real-time as you edit the code.
